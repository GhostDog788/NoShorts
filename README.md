# NoShorts
Chrome extension for removing Shorts from YouTube

### Installation

To install the extension, clone the repository to your computer.

- Navigate to the Chrome Extensions Manager at chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" at the top right corner of the page.
- Load the extension by pressing the "Load unpacked" button at the top left corner of the page.
- Open the directory of the cloned repository. 
- This should be it, though reloading the extension by pressing "Reload" next to the extension is recommended.

Now the extension should work, and you will not see any Shorts videos while browsing YouTube. 

Enjoy!
